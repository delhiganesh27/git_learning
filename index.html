        <p id="summary">Kumaraswami Kamaraj, (born July 15, 1903, Virudunagar, India—died October 2, 1975, Madras [now Chennai]), Indian independence activist and statesman who rose from humble beginnings to become a legislator in the Madras Presidency (an administrative unit of British India that encompassed much of southern India), chief minister (head of government) of the successor Madras state in independent India (now largely occupied by Tamil Nadu state and also including portions of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala states), and president of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party).</p>
        
        <h2 for="Early_life">Early life:</h2>
        <p id="Early_life">Kamaraj was born in what is now southern Tamil Nadu to a family of the Nadar (next-to-lowest) caste. His father, a coconut merchant, died when Kamaraj was a young boy. When he was 12 years old, he dropped out of school and began working in a cloth shop. He soon found himself drawn to the Indian independence movement against British rule and began attending public meetings held by local Congress Party leaders and later volunteering in various capacities (e.g., organizing fund-raising rallies for the party in his home district).

            Kamaraj joined the party at age 17, just as the noncooperation movement (1920–22) led by Mohandas K. Gandhi was getting under way, and became a full-time worker for the independence cause. His participation in the Salt March act of civil disobedience (satyagraha) in 1930 earned him a sentence of two years in prison (he was released in 1931 as part of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact agreement). He would be imprisoned several more times by the British, notably in 1942–45 for his prominent role in the Congress Party’s large-scale Quit India campaign against British rule. He used his time in prison to give himself the education he had not received as a child.</p>

        <p class="social_life">Kamaraj was elected to the Madras Presidency legislature in 1937 and again in 1946. In 1936 he had been named general secretary of the Madras branch of the Congress Party, and in 1940 he became its president. In 1947 he was elevated to the Working Committee of the national party, and he remained associated with that group until 1969. He was also a member of the Constituent Assembly that in 1946 drafted the constitution for soon-to-be independent India. In 1951 Kamaraj contested and won a seat in the elections to the first Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament).</p>
    <p class="social_life">In 1954 Kamaraj was elected chief minister for Madras state, and in 1957 he won a seat in the state legislative assembly. While in office he was credited with greatly advancing education in the state through programs that built new schools, introduced compulsory education, and provided meals and free uniforms for students. His administration improved the state’s economy by implementing a large number of irrigation projects and enacting laws that protected small farmers from exploitation by landlords. In 1963 he voluntarily left office under what came to be known as the Kamaraj Plan, which called for the voluntary resignations of high-level national and state officials in order to devote their efforts to rebuilding the Congress Party at the grassroots level following India’s disastrous border war with China.

        Soon thereafter he was appointed president of the party. He was largely responsible for placing Lal Bahadur Shastri in the prime ministership in 1964 and Indira Gandhi in 1966—both times defeating the future prime minister and Gandhi opponent Morarji Desai. Kamaraj was defeated in the 1967 state legislative elections. Soon after, he was maneuvered out of the party leadership by Gandhi as she consolidated her power. In January 1969 he won a by-election to the Lok Sabha, and later that year he was part of an old-guard leaders’ group that tried to remove Gandhi from power. The party split, however, leaving Kamaraj and his associates with a small splinter group. He nonetheless won reelection to his seat in 1971 and retained it until his death.

        <p id="after_life">Kamaraj’s low social origins contributed to his success in bringing low-caste and Dalit (formerly “untouchable”) voters into the Congress fold. He underscored his strong belief in personal contact by visiting nearly all the villages in his state more than once. In 1976 he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award.</p>
